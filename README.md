# Yuki LLM
Yuki LLM is an AI designed around Dockerfiles and anything related to
the creation of Dockerfiles. Since Docker has a high skill-ceiling with
Alpine Linux, I purposefully tweaked the DeepSeek-Coder:33b model to
have much needed context, so that when I request it to work with my 
Dockerfiles, it has the context it needs to do so.
