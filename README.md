# Yuki LLM
Welcome to Yuki LLM, a Docker specialized AI that is designed to help with all the hurdles coming from minOS Docker Environments. This was made wiht the intent to assist me, as when I code, I need some AI to keep track of all my context, since over 80% of the responses I get are flat out wrong.

However, my goal is not to limit this LLM to Docker language, but also have instructions for whatever libraries/frameworks I like to play around with. There's a lot of quirks involving modern libraries, and being able to overcome these hurdles will at least help me with a consistent coding environment of a localized LLM environment.

If this project does well, I may consider creating a server-side version that works, however, at a small scale
